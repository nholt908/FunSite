A fun website assignment for COMS 3163 Web Programming

The goal of this assignment was to make a page about my favorite character from any book, movie, tv show, or video game. I chose to do a website about Dimitri from Fire Emblem Three Houses.
The CSS for this assignment was intended to be colorful and fun.
